# Raptorize

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/sibartlett/atom-raptorize.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Raptorize your Atom.

Run Raptorize from the Command Palette ```cmd-shift-P```.

This is a port of [Raptorize](http://zurb.com/playground/jquery-raptorize), a jQuery plugin by ZURB, for the [Atom text editor](http://atom.io).
In addition to ZURB, we also owe credit to [Phil Coffman](http://twitter.com/philcoffman) and [Noah Stokes](http://twitter.com/motherfuton) for the raptor assets and the brilliance of adding a Raptor to a design.
